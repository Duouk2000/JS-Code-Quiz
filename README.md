# JS-Code-Quiz

## Description

The aim of this project is to create a quiz that records your score and displays it in a high score table. The table can be cleared and/or the quiz can be taken again.

The website can be viewed [here](https://duouk2000.github.io/JS-Code-Quiz)

## Installation

NA

## Usage

Click on the 'Start Quiz' button to generate the first question. A timer will begin counting down from 60. If you answer the question correctly, a sound will play to confirm this and the next question will be generated. If you answer the question incorrectly, a sound will play to confirm you have answered the question incorrectly and 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer. When you reach the end of the game, your remaining time is your score. You are prompted to input your initials which are saved in a highscore table along with your score.

The highscore table can be cleared and you can also retake the test.
